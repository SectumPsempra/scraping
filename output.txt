The Budokan, as it is known, has had so many uses over the years, from Led Zeppelin concerts to Muhammad Ali’s hybrid rules fight with Antonio Inoki, that it is often difficult to keep track. But in a world of failed Olympic legacies and discarded stadiums, its initial reason for existence remains as relevant as ever. The arena was built just in time for the 1964 Olympics, when it was the first site of judo’s enduring presence in the Games. It has become a notable venue for martial arts. On Wednesday it assumed a similar role to 1964 by welcoming karate into the Olympic Games.  The island of Okinawa is where karate’s heart resides and its first Olympic showcase is a consequence of its popularity here. Over the final days of the Olympics two distinctive styles are on show. In the kata, as demonstrated in the early rounds of the women’s competition on Thursday morning, the karatekas choose from 102 predetermined series of techniques and perform them with as much precision and dynamism as they can. What seems difficult to follow in theory is relatively easy. The two outstanding performers were clear, with the speed of Japan’s Kiyou Shimizu instantly distinguishing her in her pool. She was joined in the final by the dominant power of Sandra Sánchez, the 39-year-old undisputed No 1 who is widely considered the greatest of all time in her category and who duly clinched the gold medal. Alongside kata were the numerous kumite bouts, a more familiar spectacle of one-on-one combat. In three-minute bouts the aim is to land blows at the opponent but judges decide whether the techniques are sufficient enough to count as a point. Every blow landed was punctuated by “kiai” – the energy-harnessing screams that circled the Budokan throughout. All the participants have hopes for what the new eyes on karate will bring. For Sakura Kokumai, an American with familial roots in Japan who lost a heart-wrenching bronze-medal kata bout, her will is to be seen as a true athlete. “We’ve been doing this for the love of our sport and martial art,” said Kokumai, who attended the Budokan many times before the Games when she studied in Japan. “I really hope people are able to see what we do as athletes. We train very hard just like any other athlete and I believe we belong here in the Olympics.” Jesús del Moral, Sanchez’s coach and husband, stressed the importance of increased participation. “I like to tell them that karate is for everybody,” he said. “Everybody can practise. The sport is important but not all. I think it’s the way to show the world what karate is. It doesn’t matter the age, the sex. Anybody can practise.” It was difficult not to be drawn in by the journey of Hamoon Derafshipour, an Iranian karateka and a world championship bronze medallist in 2018. While all other competitors entered the arena before their bouts with male, and often older, coaches by their sides, Derafshipour was accompanied by his wife, Samira Malekipour. That is rare in any men’s sport but the pair’s route to this moment is surely unique. They decided to leave their home country in 2019, emigrating to Canada where he would have the agency to elect Malekipour as his coach. He secured his Olympics berth as a member of the Refugee Olympic Team and he arrived in Tokyo intending to win a medal. But he endured a tough day in Thursday’s kumite bouts in the -67kg competition. He won two and lost two, finishing in third, when the top two advance to the semi-final. In his final bout, already eliminated, Derafshipour suffered a bloody lip, had his gumshield fly out on to the carpet numerous times and took one particularly heavy blow as he clinched his second win. He was already crying as he walked off the competition floor. When he reached the mixed zone area, he kneeled on the ground and sobbed loudly. He understandably did not stop for an interview. His tears were a reflection of the sacrifices made and the importance of this competition despite it holding no history in the sport. But perhaps they reflected also the fleeting chance this is for all. Karate will not be in the 2024 Paris Olympics. For those who did not perform to their standards this opportunity may never come again.', 'Hottest Olympics in history will put pressure on organisers to rethink sport in light of climate crisis First published on Thu 5 Aug 2021 17.27 BST Olympic athletes and volunteers in Tokyo are being “tortured” by dangerous heat, meteorologists have said, as the hottest Games in history puts pressure on organisers to rethink the future of sport in a climate-disrupted world. Temperatures hit 34C in the Japanese capital on Thursday with humidity of nearly 70%. Athletes and sports scientists say the combination of heat and moisture has led to “brutal” conditions that must be avoided at future events.  This could limit the range for endurance sports in terms of geography, season and time of day. Pressure will grow for big events to be moved to cooler seasons, higher latitudes, morning and evenings. Many elite athletes, like many specialist species, will see their habitat shrink. Tokyo 2020 has highlighted the risk of trying to continue with sporting business as usual. At least two tennis players – Kazakhstan’s Zarina Diyas and Spain’s Paula Badosa – retired mid-match with heat exhaustion, and Badosa was taken off court in a wheelchair. Russia’s Daniil Medvedev needed two medical timeouts in his men’s singles quarter-final. “I can finish the match, but I can die,” he told the umpire. “If I die, are you going to be responsible?” Medvedev said after the game that he hadn’t been able to breathe, felt “darkness” in his eyes and “was ready to just fall down on the court”. The world No 1, Novak Djokovic said the conditions were tougher than anything he had experienced in a 20-year career. “You’re constantly dehydrated, you feel you have weights on your shoulders because there’s so much heat and humidity and stagnated air,” he said. He and others have demanded a rethink of the schedule, and organisers have said they will add two days to the tournament at the next Olympics to allow for more recovery time and fewer matches in the midday sun. Water sports have offered no relief. Long distance swimmers had to wake up before dawn so their event could start at 6:30am and finish before the worst of the morning heat. Even so, the water temperature in Tokyo Bay rose to 29C, which was described as being as “hot as soup”. The artificial rapids for the canoe slalom were so warm that one competitor, Matej Benus of Slovakia, described them as “like paddling in bathwater.” The Russian archer Svetlana Gomboeva was treated for heat exhaustion, and beach volleyball players said the sand had been almost too hot to stand on. Brazil’s 2016 gold medallist Bruno Schmidt, was astonished: “The first two weeks here are one of the hottest that I had in my life, believe it or not.” Sayaka Mori, a meteorologist with the NHK broadcaster, said the high moisture content of the air on Wednesday meant that temperatures felt above 40C, which is dangerously high. “Oppressive heat is really torturing the Olympians and volunteers in Tokyo,” she tweeted. “Be careful of heatstroke.” Thursday was warmer still. The director general of the Games, Toshiro Muto, said only 30 people had suffered mild heat-related illness thanks to countermeasures, including ice jackets, mist-sprays, salt tablets and rescheduling events to cooler evenings. “I believe our steps have been working well so far,” he said. For the highest risk events – which include athletics, beach volleyball, cycling, football, hockey, marathon swimming, modern pentathlon, rowing, rugby, tennis and triathlon – sports scientists advised organisers to set up “heat decks” for treatment, including cool-down baths. Two endurance events – the marathon and the race walk – were moved 800km north to the usually much cooler Hokkaido, but the island is in throes of its most severe heatwave for 97 years. Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Athens, Atlanta, Sydney, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro all registered peak temperatures in the mid 30Cs. But Tokyo is more relentlessly warm and humid, the two elements in wet bulb globe temperature (WGBT), which is the key measurement for heat-stress risk. “Tokyo is regularly experiencing WBGT conditions of more than 30C, some days peaking above 32C. That is several degrees above Rio, London, Beijing and other Olympics” said Oliver Gibson, a senior lecturer in exercise physiology at Brunel University. It a far cry from the “mild and sunny weather” that the Tokyo bid committee had promised in 2013 as “an ideal climate for athletes to perform at their best”. They should have known better. As early as 1964 – the last time Tokyo hosted the Olympics – organisers were wary enough of the summer heat to schedule the Games in October. Since then the city has been getting hotter. Temperatures have risen by 2.9C since 1900, according to Nasa. almost three times the global average. This is largely because the city has been encased in so much concrete that warm air gets trapped, leading to an “urban heat-island effect”. Human-caused global heating is driving up temperatures across the planet and threatening to turn festivals of sport into endurance ordeals, according to Russell Seymour, the founder of the British Association for Sustainable Sport. “Athletes testing themselves at the highest levels of human capacity are being asked to compete in environments that are becoming hostile to human physiology. Our love and appetite for sports risks straying into brutality,” he wrote ahead of the Games. Exertional heatstroke is one of the top three causes of sudden death in athletes and explains why heatwaves tend to kill a disproportionately high number of 15 to 19-year-old men. It occurs when strenuous exercise, often in hot and humid conditions, pushes core body temperatures to 40C, beyond which sweating and other cooling techniques are inadequate and organ functions start to collapse. Athletes can adapt, up to a point. Paul Hough, a sports scientist at Oxford Brookes University, has helped British Olympians, F1 drivers and tennis players with heat acclimatisation, usually carried out on a treadmill in an enclosed chamber where humidity can be raised as high as 86%. Hough said heat stress came in three stages: heat cramps, which affect performance and can make the athlete dizzy; heat exhaustion, when energy is so run down that competitors have to withdraw, as was the case with Paula Radcliffe in the 2004 Athens marathon; and heatstroke, which can be fatal if not treated rapidly by ice-jackets, cold baths and slush drinks – all of which are in use in Tokyo. In WBGT conditions in the mid-30Cs, however, even this is not always enough. “You can do all the acclimatisation training you like, but there is a point when the body reaches its limits. You can just about play football in 40C, but all the quality goes out of the game. When you reach those extremes, organisers have to move things around, schedule in the evening or choose a different date in the calendar.” Next year’s World Cup in Qatar has been moved to the winter for this reason. In the UK, the British Association of Sport and Exercise Science recently started work on an action plan to “tackle the climate emergency” . It is scheduled for release ahead of Cop26 in Glasgow in November. Gibson predicts heat will change the way sport is run in the future. “With climate change and the globalisation of sport, I think it is certain that the sporting landscape will be impactedby temperature more and more. In the future, we may be looking at some locations being unable to host sporting competition due to rises in temperature.” It may also be necessary to arrange more breaks in play, delay competition and adjust schedules. “I foresee the big battle here will likely be with broadcasters, rather than the sportsmen and women themselves.”', 'By Joshua Berlinger, Aditi Sangal and Adam Renton, CNN Our live coverage of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics has moved here. From CNN\'s Jill Martin  Americans April Ross and Alix Klineman have won the gold medal in women\'s beach volleyball. The duo beat Australians Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar in two sets, 21-15 and 21-16. The win gives the US a record-extending fourth Olympic gold medal in the event. Famed duo Kerri Walsh Jennings and Misty May-Treanor won gold three times in a row for the US from 2004 to 2012. After previously winning silver at the 2012 London Games and bronze at Rio 2016, Ross, 39, has now secured her first Olympic gold medal. This was the 31-year-old Klineman\'s Olympic debut. Earlier Friday, Switzerland’s Anouk Verge-Depre and Joana Heidrich defeated Latvia’s Tina Graudina and Anastasija Kravcenoka in straight sets to win bronze. From CNN\'s Chandler Thornton Tokyo 2020 organizers reported 29 new Covid-19 cases linked to the Olympics on Friday, bringing the total number of recorded infections from the Games to 387. The new cases are not among athletes or residents of Tokyo\'s Olympic Village. They were identified as contractors, Games-related personnel, volunteers, and one member of the media. There have been 33 total cases reported from the village as of Friday.\xa0\xa0 On Thursday, Tokyo reported more than 5,000 new cases in a record single-day high. Tokyo 2020 organizers maintain the Games are not related to the rise in cases in Japan\'s capital. From CNN\'s Helen Regan\xa0and Jennifer Hauser The International Olympic Committee has revoked the accreditation of two Belarusian coaches allegedly involved in trying to force sprinter\xa0Kristina Timanovskaya\xa0to return home against her will. Belarus head coach Yuri Moisevich and team official Artur Shumak were removed from the Olympic Village in Tokyo and their Games accreditation canceled, the IOC said in a tweet Friday. On Sunday, Timanovskaya, 24,\xa0said Belarus team officials\xa0threatened her, removed her from the Olympic team and forced her to the airport in Tokyo, where she would board a flight back to Belarus after she criticized sporting authorities. Fearing she would be arrested in Belarus, Timanovskaya refused to get on the flight and on Wednesday\xa0fled to Warsaw,\xa0Poland, where she has been granted a visa on humanitarian grounds. Read more:   From CNN\'s Rebecca Saunders High temperatures during the Tokyo Olympics have been making headlines\xa0around the world. In fact, the event may go down as one of the hottest and most humid in the history of the Games. Last week, current world No. 2 tennis player Daniil Medvedev said the heat and humidity were "some of the worst" conditions he had played in, even asking\xa0who would be responsible\xa0if he died. Elsewhere, athletes have been seen donning ice vests, wet towels and downing water after competing. But the temperatures and high humidity currently cooking the capital are not unusual. Japanese summers are notoriously sticky and sweaty, and for many Japanese people, spooky. Friends flock to haunted houses, head to the movies for horror flicks or visit graveyards after dark, all in an attempt to scare themselves into literally getting the chills — in effect forgetting all about the sweltering heat. Read more: By Rebecca Saunders, CNN  From CNN\'s Jill Martin   Dawid Tomala of Poland has won gold in the men’s 50 kilometers race walk at the Tokyo 2020 Games — potentially the last time this event will ever be held in an Olympics.  Germany’s Jonathan Hilbert took silver, while Evan Dunfee of Canada earned bronze. This race started with 59 participants. At the time of this post, nine have dropped out, while two have been disqualified. This event will not be held at the Paris 2024 Games.   Another day full of athletic feats and achievements has been etched into history at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.  If you\'re just reading in now, here are some of the highlights and key storylines from Thursday\'s Games:   Kristina Timanovskaya, the Olympic sprinter from Belarus who defected to Poland,\xa0said she hopes to compete in "at least two more" Olympics in the future. During a joint press conference with Belarusian opposition politician Pavel Latushko\xa0in Warsaw, Poland\xa0today, the 24-year old said she is "very saddened by the fact that I was deprived of my chance to participate in the Olympic Games." Timanovskaya could not compete due to Belarusian team officials pulling her from the women\'s 200 meter sprint after she criticized the country\'s sport authorities on social media.\xa0 Timanovskaya refused to return to Belarus over safety concerns and instead is seeking asylum for herself and her husband in Poland, where she awaits a hearing from the International Olympic Committee. Regarding the hearing, Latushko said the sprinter\'s interests are being represented by a lawyer from Japan and the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation.\xa0 The sprinter received offers of asylum from multiple European countries, but Timanovskaya  chose Poland because it is close enough for her parents to visit and she also wishes to  continue her athletic career there. CNN\'s Alyssa Kraus, Hannah Ritchie,\xa0Jaide Garcia and Katya Krebs\xa0contributed to this post. From CNN’s Alyssa Kraus and Aleks Klosok   The women\'s football final has been moved to a later kick-off time and switched to a different venue due to heat concerns. The gold medal match between Sweden and Canada had originally been scheduled for 11 a.m. local time on Friday in Tokyo. However, both teams expressed concerns over heat and humidity. Olympic organizers confirmed today that the match will now take place at 9 p.m. local time in Yokohama, Japan. For US viewers, the match will be broadcast at 8 a.m. ET on Friday. This change also impacts the men\'s bronze medal match between Mexico and Japan, which will now kick off at 6 p.m. local at the Saitama Stadium or 5 a.m. ET. Sweden hopes to go one step further than the 2016 Olympic Games, where the team lost 2-1 in the final. Meanwhile, Canadian midfielder Quinn, the first openly trans and non-binary athlete at a Games, will be guaranteed to win a medal at the Tokyo Games. From Katya Krebs and Hannah Ritchie   Belarusian Olympic sprinter Kristina Timanovskaya, who defected to Poland, told reporters Thursday that she hopes she and her husband will be able to stay.  “Once my husband arrives here today, we should make this decision together. I cannot answer anything without him, but I definitely hope we can stay here, and I can continue my sports career and my husband can find some work,” she said during a press conference in Warsaw. Timanovskaya was set to compete in the women\'s 200m at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday. Instead, she says representatives of the Belarus national team tried to forcibly send her home for criticizing sporting authorities on her social media.\xa0 After receiving several offers of asylum from European countries, Timanovskaya said she had chosen Poland because her parents thought it was the easiest place for them to try and visit.\xa0 "We chose Poland because I spoke to my parents who said that perhaps Poland will be the best choice for me because they probably would be able to come to visit me sometimes," she said Thursday.\xa0 When asked about her last-minute decision not to return to Belarus, Timanovskaya said she was “not thinking about political asylum” and that the decision was motivated by her wish to remain in sport.\xa0 “I was not thinking about political asylum. All I want is to remain in sports and continue my sports career here,” she told reporters.\xa0 Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Timanovskaya accused representative of the Belarus national team of taking away her dream by denying her the chance to compete in the women\'s 200 meters at the Olympics.\xa0 Timanovskaya said the Belarusian media have already started to slander her in recent days over the incident.\xa0 “My parents have told me that they are already talking about me on TV and saying very bad things. That I did not take the chance to run the Olympics ... that I am not a good enough sportswoman and all that. I have been sent photos from Telegram channels where people posted links to my Instagram with requests to write bad things to me,” she explained.\xa0 “Yes, I have received many awful messages. But at that moment, I have been receiving a lot of messages of support from people. I was reading more positive comments than negative,” she added.', 'Last modified on Thu 5 Aug 2021 13.53 BST Team USA progressed to the Tokyo 2020 men’s basketball gold medal game after downing a valiant Australia in their match-up on Thursday. It was heartbreak for the Boomers as they fell to their fifth Olympic semi-final defeat across five decades. The Australians must now regroup for the bronze medal clash on Saturday, as they continue their search for the nation’s first international medal in men’s basketball. The Americans now face France, who beat them in the teams’ opening game, for gold. The French beat Slovenia 90-89 in a thrilling semi-final that went down to the last play.   Stretching back to 1964, Australia and the US have met eight times in Olympic competition. The closest the Boomers had come to defeating the Americans was two 10-point losses, in 2004 and 2016. Victories for Australia in a 2019 friendly and in a pre-Tokyo 2020 warm-up game last month offered some hope – as did a positive first-half performance. But ultimately the Americans’ star power was too much for the Patty Mills-led Boomers, losing 97-78. Kevin Durant was ever-present for Team USA with 23 points and nine defensive rebounds, while Devin Booker picked up 20 points thanks to his shooting accuracy. Jrue Holiday had eight rebounds and eight assists. For Australia, Mills led the scoring with 15 points but his usually reliable radar was off, only shooting 36% from the field. The first quarter started cautiously, with each team feeling out the other’s defence. A hungry Australian offence had the better of the early looks, although nerves and a few missed opportunities prevented the Boomers from opening up a significant lead. But a Chris Goulding three-point shot on the buzzer saw Australia head into their quarter-time huddle with a six-point advantage. Early in the second quarter there was a moment that epitomised the Australian team spirit. After Joe Ingles was roughed up by an American opponent, the Boomers bench leapt from their seats in unison to protest the lack of a foul call. Referees Michael Weiland and Manuel Mazzoni were unimpressed at the insolence, and awarded a technical foul against Australia. But it was worth it for the Australians, a show of team spirit lifting the five on the court. It sent the Boomers on a run, stretching their lead to 15 points midway through the second quarter. A lack of concentration then saw the momentum swing, as Team USA clawed their way back into the game – Devin Booker making the most of wide open-look from the corner. By the half-time siren, Australia’s margin had been cut to just three points. Led by Brooklyn Nets star Durant, Team USA overhauled the deficit at the beginning of the third. By the time Jock Landale made a lay-up midway through proceedings, Australia had been scoreless for seven minutes and the Americans had added 20 points unanswered. A made-for-YouTube Zach LaVine dunk and a Booker three point shot on the buzzer underscored the United States’ dominance as they closed the quarter ahead by 19. The Australian fightback never came. Despite the best efforts of Mills, Landale and Ingles, Team USA remained in control throughout the final quarter. The final minutes saw sloppiness from both sides as fatigue set in. The Boomers can feel aggrieved at the officiating by Weiland and Mazzoni, who harshly penalised Australia and gave the Americans the benefit of the doubt. But there can be no questioning that the better team won. Australia is a strong basketball nation and has continued to improve in the past decade. But the gulf between them and Team USA – who have won 15 Olympic gold medals since 1936 – remained evident on Thursday. “We knew Australia would come out fast and hit us with a nice punch,” said Durant, the Team USA captain, after the win. “We know that teams want to get us down early, see how we respond. A lot of these guys got continuity for years and years so they know how to play with each other. I feel like a lot of teams are expecting us to fold early. “We stuck with it, stuck with our principles, made a couple of switches on defence, and we were able to get some momentum going into the half. Guys came out with that intensity, making shots as well.” Australia’s Landale, who recently signed with the San Antonio Spurs, said the third quarter slump cost the Boomers. “We just lost them there in a little patch in that third quarter and it’s tough to come back from 20 down,” he said. “We tried to stick with it and fight back in the fourth but they’re the best players in the world.” Australia good, Americans better – as has so often been the case for the Boomers on the Olympic stage. On Saturday, they will go again and hope to avenge their one-point defeat in the bronze medal game in 2016, against the loser of the other semi-final, Slovenia. Team USA, meanwhile, affirmed their status as gold medal favourites. Plus ça change.', 'Last modified on Fri 6 Aug 2021 05.00 BST Bronze, gold, bronze. Great Britain’s women made history by getting some metal round their necks for a third straight Olympic Games – take note, men – thanks to Grace Balsdon’s decisive penalty corner strike to win a thrilling, helter-skelter bronze medal final against India. Who says nobody cares about losers’ finals? This was a pulsating match, Britain racing into a 2-0 lead before India hit back with three goals in four minutes, only for the deposed champions to drag themselves off the canvas in the second half and eventually prevail 4-3. It was a triumph of resilience as much as anything else and also meant they made history as the first British Olympic hockey team, male or female, to win a medal at three consecutive Games. These girls can.  The match was played in searing heat and in the third quarter Olympic hockey history was also made when the first mid-quarter drinks break took place as the pitch-side temperature reached 42C. It begged the question: why were the players being put through this? The women’s football gold medal match had also been scheduled to begin on the same brutally hot Tokyo morning, 30 minutes after this hockey bronze final. But after some pressure the football was switched to the slightly cooler evening. It seems reasonable to think this match could also have been moved to sundown as an appetiser to the Netherlands-Argentina main event. Pushback at 2.30am in London and 7am in Mumbai doesn’t do hockey’s exposure to the TV masses any favours either. But if hockey will forever be a poor relation to football in the harsh world of headlines and sponsorship, and a bronze medal match in any sport is always the bridesmaid, there was no mistaking the desire of Great Britain to go home with a medal. From pushback it was a wave of red attacking India, whose goalkeeper Savita was forced into two excellent saves in the first quarter as GB enjoyed the lion’s share of possession. Thirty seconds into the second quarter Britain made the breakthrough. Ellie Rayer burst down the right and dribbled her way to the byline, then flashed a dangerous ball across the face of goal which was deflected into the net by an Indian stick. Ten minutes later it was 2-0, a free-flowing move down the right finished in some style by Sarah Robertson and Britain looked in total command. But India weren’t reading the script and the match was turned on its head in an astonishing four-minute episode in which they scored three goals. First, Gurjit Kaur swept past Maddie Hinch in Britain’s goal from a penalty corner. A minute later she repeated the trick, a superbly precise penalty corner drag-flick levelling the match. India’s tails were up and moments later Sharmila Devi was clean through but Hinch did enough to put her off. India weren’t done yet and, incredibly, scored a third when Vandana Katariya flicked home in a goalmouth scramble with Britain reeling on the ropes. Half-time couldn’t come soon enough. The break gave Britain time to clear their heads and they set off in the second half like a team possessed. Within five minutes the match was level at 3-3 when the captain Hollie Pearne-Webb fired high into Savita’s net. Britain turned the screw in the searing heat and they took back the lead three minutes into the final quarter when India were a player down to a yellow card, Balsdon’s clinical penalty corner strike ricocheting off the backboard to cheers from the British contingent in the stadium. From there, it was game management all the way to the hooter and a hard-fought medal. If the future is always going to be shaded orange in women’s hockey given Dutch domination, the future for GB feels pretty bright too after a tournament in which only the Netherlands stood head and shoulders above them.']}
